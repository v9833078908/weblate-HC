# weblate-mcp-server

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 25e61af: Fix module loading errors by upgrading @rekog/mcp-nest from 1.5.2 to 1.9.2

  This resolves the "Cannot find module 'zod-json-schema-compat.js'" error that occurred with the older bundled version. Additionally, zod has been upgraded to v4.0.0 to satisfy peer dependencies, and the postbuild script now uses shx for cross-platform chmod compatibility, ensuring the package works correctly on Windows systems.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5da243a: Add bulkWriteTranslations tool for efficient batch translation updates

  - Added `bulkWriteTranslations` MCP tool for updating multiple translations in a single operation
  - Implemented concurrency control (5 parallel requests) to prevent API overload
  - Added comprehensive error handling with individual failure tracking
  - Provides detailed success/failure reporting with summary statistics
  - Supports batch approval functionality for translations
  - Added progress logging for monitoring large batch operations
  - Updated all documentation to include the new bulk update functionality

  This tool is ideal for:

  - CSV/Excel import workflows
  - Mass correction of translation errors
  - Batch approval of multiple translations
  - Migration of translations between components

  The bulk update tool processes translations efficiently while providing detailed feedback about successes and failures, making it safe for large-scale translation operations.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d2859e2: Remove inefficient translation tools to enforce better LLM usage patterns

  - Removed `listTranslationKeys` tool that encouraged inefficient list-then-check patterns
  - Removed `searchTranslationKeys` tool that only returned key names without translation status
  - Removed `searchTranslationsByKey` tool that was duplicate functionality
  - Kept efficient tools: `searchUnitsWithFilters`, `searchStringInProject`, `writeTranslation`, `findTranslationsForKey`, and `getTranslationForKey`
  - LLMs are now guided toward using Weblate's native filtering syntax via `searchUnitsWithFilters` for optimal performance

  This change prevents LLMs from making thousands of individual API calls when they could use a single efficient filtered search instead.
